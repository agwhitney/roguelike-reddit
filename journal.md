Hello!
######

My contribution to the r/roguelikedev all-encompassing roguelike tutorial will not only be a roguelike, but a journal/guide of sorts to document what I did and possibly give insight for others doing the same thing

So let's get started just to get started, and we'll make it pretty in the future (will we, though?)

Day 1 -- 20 June 2017
#######################
So what did I do on day 1?
-I hurt my neck, for one thing (something related to waking up).
-I created a working folder I called 'roguelike/' and created a virtual environment in it running Python 3.6.
	I'm under the impression that r/roguelikedev is going to be using Python 2.7, which I would prefer not to do 
    (and I don't think that it's really the best solution for people new to Python either; why would you start with the old thing?).
	I'm sure other people will also use 3.6, so I'm sure it will be fine.
-I set up a bash alias in ~/.bash_aliases to create a shortcut into my virtual environment.
-I created a git repository to have some version control from the very beginning.
    I also made a .gitignore file, to ignore the 'venv/' folder

That's all that's outlined for today, and I think it's a solid prep process for the beginnings of a project!
