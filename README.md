## Roguelike Game Project

**This is a project following with the r/roguelikedev 10-week Python tutorial**, specifically using Python3.6 and libtcod!

There isn't much to see here, but there is a journal.md where I'll be keeping track of the things I do.
It won't be a copy of the tutorial, but will some of my thoughts and points and notes that I consider worth jotting down.
Eventually* there's a chance that I go through this and that and make them more readable and pedagogical.
